# Purpose
- Show your understanding of a topic. 
- Presentation skills.

# Format
- A talk of length 10-15 minutes. 
- Slides. (Required for everyone. You need to submit those slides. )
- You can use the whiteboard during your talk.

# Structure
1. Introduce the topic. Given the basic definition. Or state the problem you try to solve. (Be friendly to you audience.)
2. Solve the problem, typically you present a proof. Or if you are introducing some mathematical software, demo what kind of problem it can solve and how to solve it.
3. Summerize the skills that you used form this course. 
4. Q and A. 
# Topics.
I don't sugguest topics. You need to pick you own topics. However, the following topics are just examples to help you understand what is expected.

<strong>Set Theory and Mathematical Logic:</strong> 
1. More application of Cantor's Diagonalization trick in proof. 
2. Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein theorem. 
3. [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) theorem prover.
4. SAT solver [tutorial](https://www.borealisai.com/research-blogs/tutorial-9-sat-solvers-i-introduction-and-applications/). 

<strong>Recursive function, inductive proof, and counting</strong>
1. Problems that has beautiful recursive solutions that we haven't talked about yet in the class. For example, 
    - [Derangement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement)
    - [Domino and Tromino Tiling](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/)
2. Inductive proofs and possiblely the recursive algorithms inspired by them. 
3. Counting with recursion. For instance, [the Catalan Numbers](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/more/mdm/sec_basic-catalan.html).
4. Generating functions of counting problems. See example in [*Generatingfunctionology*](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/gfology2.pdf).
5. Correctness of an algorithm by induction. 
6. Recursive definitions and structural inductive proof. Example: propositional logic string parsing.

<strong>Graphs and trees.</strong>
1. Recursive algorithms on Graphs and trees. 
2. Proofs on graphs and trees. 

The above list is not intended to be complete. Again, I expect that you will do you owe research to pick your own topic.
