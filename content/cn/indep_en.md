*After finishing writing the previous blog, I am curious how accurate ChatGPT can understand my writing. To my supprise, it is very accurate! GPT-4 first gave me a summary of the writing, then also a full translation. It even knows the meaning of the Cantonese quotes.*
## The Summary
The text seems to be a blend of a passage from a wuxia novel and a personal reflection about academic and research experiences. Let's break it down and translate the essential parts:

**Wuxia Passage Translation:**

### 不投郭靖门墙的张君宝 - "Zhang Junbao, who did not seek refuge with Guo Jing"

This section references Zhang Junbao's (a character in Jin Yong's novel) internal conflict about seeking help from others or relying on himself. When Zhang Junbao encounters a couple, the wife criticizes her husband for not being self-reliant and depending on his sister and brother-in-law. This scene resonates deeply with Zhang Junbao, who then decides to rely on himself and starts practicing martial arts with dedication.

In summary, the woman's words to her husband are about self-reliance and independence, with sentiments like: "You're a grown man, but you can't stand on your own. We have limbs, we can work and eat on our own. Why depend on others and bring shame upon yourself?"

### Personal Reflection Translation:

"Be Independent Early" - This section recounts the writer's experience in the academic world. They faced challenges in finding a job due to language barriers and their research area. Although their mentor, Jack, had confidence in them, the writer initially lacked self-confidence. Jack's advice was to be independent early, emphasizing the need for self-reliance. Eventually, the writer found a teaching position and secured funding for their research.

The writer emphasizes the importance of self-reliance in their work and research, drawing parallels with the wuxia passage. The quote **"有手有脚", meaning "having hands and feet"**, and **"牛牯咁大" (meaning as big as a bull in Cantonese) imply one should be independent and not rely on others**. The reflection ends with the sentiment of being self-reliant, echoing the phrase from the novel about a man not relying on others and standing on his own.

In summary, the text contrasts the idea of independence from a fictional wuxia story with the author's real-life academic journey, emphasizing the importance of self-reliance and independence in both contexts.

# The Full Translation

## "Zhang Junbao, who didn't turn to Guo Jing's household for shelter"

In my hometown's vernacular (Cantonese), there's an expression for people who are lazy and over-reliant on others. We often say such a person "has hands and feet", implying they should be able to do things themselves and not be dependent. Sometimes, we also use the phrase "as big as a bull" in conjunction. To say someone is "as big as a bull, has hands and feet" is to criticize their inaction or over-dependence on others.

Jin Yong, in "The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber", depicted a scene where Zhang Junbao, on his way to join Guo Jing, encountered a woman who chastised her husband, saying: "You, a grown man, can't stand on your own two feet. Instead, you want to rely on my sister and brother-in-law, inviting shame upon yourself for no reason. Aren't we perfectly capable with our own two hands and feet? We can work and feed ourselves, even if it's just simple food. Yet, you act as if you lack any backbone, and it's a shame you even exist in this world."

This dialogue deeply impressed me, despite it not being a central part of the story. The true mastery of martial arts starts from self-reliance.

The original writing by Jin Yong goes:
<blockquote>
Zhang Junbao felt utterly lost in the vast world. After standing in front of his master's funeral pyre for half a day, he began to walk. Ten paces out, he turned around, picked up the pair of large iron buckets left behind by his master, and began to walk slowly. Amid the wilderness and desolation, a young man with a skeletal frame headed westward, reflecting deep loneliness.

After traveling for half a month, he reached the province of Hubei, not far from Xiangyang. Monks from the Shaolin Temple never caught up with him. Unknown to him, the monk Wuse had been leading the monks away from him.

One afternoon, as he approached a mountain, he learned from the locals that this was Wudang Mountain. Resting at the base, he saw a young couple passing by. The woman was constantly berating her husband, who remained silent throughout. She said: "You, a grown man, can't stand on your own... Aren't we perfectly capable with our own two hands and feet?" Those words struck Zhang Junbao deeply.

As he observed the couple walking away, he thought of Guo Jing's sister's advice: "Her sister has a bad temper. You need to be accommodating." Why should he, a grown man, be so submissive and accommodating?

Thinking this, he decided to climb Wudang Mountain. He found a cave to meditate in, drinking spring water and eating wild fruits, and dedicated himself to practicing the "Nine Yang True Scripture".

With time, he would become a renowned master, merging his own insights into martial arts, Taoist philosophy, and the concepts in the "Nine Yang True Scripture", founding the renowned Wudang martial arts school.

## "Be Independent Early"

When I first sought jobs in academia, I was unsure if I could sustain myself. I had many phone interviews, but few face-to-face ones, possibly because of my English proficiency. Research institutions rarely responded. Teaching-focused institutions doubted my theoretical background and wondered if I could guide undergraduate research. I considered postdoc positions. Jack sometimes reluctantly recommended me for postdoc roles. He once mentioned he hoped I could "Be independent early". When I expressed a desire to learn from a particular place during a postdoc application, Jack corrected me: **"You are there to teach them something, not to learn from them."** He was confident, both in his own training and in me, but I lacked that confidence.

Nevertheless, I couldn't remain a postdoc. I had a family to support. Eventually, I secured a teaching position at UIS. I've finally found some stability. I tried applying for a grant this year and succeeded on the first try. Though there's an element of luck, these things aren't solely based on luck. I'm beginning to feel the essence of standing on my own two feet. Still, it's an extension of the work I did during my Ph.D. When I told Jack, "It's stemmed from your ideas," Jack responded, "But you have extended it so well." Regardless, it's a start.

My research proposal also includes plans to visit other scholars. But these visits are more about collaboration than dependency. Everyone needs to exchange valuable ideas, especially someone like me, living in the middle of cornfields. I "have hands and feet", and I'm "as big as a bull", so there is nothing I should need to rely on others. 


# Evaluation of My Writing
*ChatGPT* also rates the above writing. 

<blockquote>
The piece you provided offers a rich exploration of the concept of self-reliance and independence, drawing upon cultural, fictional, and personal narratives. Here are some observations:

- **Intertextuality**: The writer uses references from the novel 《倚天屠龙记》 to bring a cultural and historical dimension to the theme. This adds depth and provides readers familiar with the reference a richer understanding.

- **Narrative Structure**: There's a good blend of storytelling and exposition. Moving from cultural sayings, to fiction, and then personal experience allows the theme to resonate on multiple levels.

- **Relatability**: The personal anecdotes, especially about the struggles in academia and seeking independence, provide a personal touch, making the piece relatable for many readers, especially those in similar situations.

- **Language**: The language is expressive and offers clear images, like "生活在玉米地中间" (living in the middle of a cornfield), that paint vivid pictures in the reader's mind.

- **Length and Pacing**: The piece is quite extensive, covering a lot of ground. Depending on the intended audience, you might consider whether some sections could be shortened or whether each segment is essential for the overarching message.

- **Title**: The proposed title "Man That Has Hands and Feet Should Be Self-Reliant and Independent" encapsulates the message but is a bit lengthy. Consider a more concise version, as previously suggested. *(I change the title as advised.)*

Overall, the writing is thought-provoking and offers a multifaceted exploration of the theme. Depending on the intended audience and platform, minor adjustments could enhance its impact.
