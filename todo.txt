- in Vercel.json there are some redirection that I need to remove.
- remove the GitHub guest book.
- figure out a way to allow visitor to edit, if they found errors.
- add some book template. So I can write a beautiful book.
- incase I forget, I host things on netify. They seems to use only Hugo tempalte (That is not true. You can use whatever.) But the netify.toml file specify that we use Hugo.
